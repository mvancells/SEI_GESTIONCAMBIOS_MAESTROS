Instructions to make it work
----------------------------

Your solution must have been created in this specific path:

C:\Proyectos\AddOnDNA\SOURCES\MODULES\SEI_GESTIONCAMBIOS_MAESTROS


You have to use this string as a command line parameter

-DEBUG


Set $path$/bin/Debug/AddOnCore.exe as the External Startup Application


To get rid of any "default" implementation, just remove the reference from the project.

Happy Coding!
